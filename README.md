Tip Calculator

Pre work for CodePath

This project took about 3.5 hours to complete.  I followed the video tutorial to complete the basic app version, and then read the additional instructions on making the setting screen.  I ran into some trouble getting the back button working from the setting screen when using the build in navigational view so I just created my own back button that went back to the app.

I made some changes to the original app.  First, I changed the percent tip options to 15%, 20% an 25% so it woudld span a wider range.  Secondly I added a number of people slider ( I googled how to code the slider ),  from 1 - 8, so that a per person amount could be shown as well.  When going to the settings screen, I noticed the app would lose any values already selected when  returing from the settings screen, so I had the app save any values like bill and tip percent so they would not be reset (I researched saving and retrieving values using Google again). I could set up a timer to set the bill back to zero if a certain about of time has passed (say 10 minutes) but I have not done that yet.  I think its fine for the app to remember the previous data, and the user can change any values the next time they use the app.

Lastly I've included a gif walkthough that demonstates the basic of how the app works.
